#Hibernate Employee Entity with @Transient Field Example
This project demonstrates a simple Hibernate application to persist an Employee entity into a database, highlighting the use of the @Transient annotation to exclude a field (ecity) from database persistence.

#Features
Entity Mapping: Maps the Employee class to a database table.

Transient Field: Demonstrates how the @Transient annotation excludes a field from being persisted.

Basic CRUD Operation: Inserts a new employee record into the database.

Hibernate Configuration: Uses hibernate.cfg.xml for database connectivity.

#Technologies Used
Java: Programming language

Hibernate ORM: Framework for object-relational mapping

Jakarta Persistence API: For JPA annotations

MySQL/PostgreSQL: Relational database

Maven: For dependency management (optional)

#Prerequisites
